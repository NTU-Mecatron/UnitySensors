## üîç Overview

UnitySensos is a projet that regroup two Unity3D packages that allow you to **easily** use Unity3D as robotic simulation !
There are several Prefab and Scene files available for testing each sensor.

**1. UnitySensor**

The following sensors are available inside :

- Velodyne 3D LiDAR (Velodyne VLP-16, VLP-16-HiRes, VLP-32, HDL-32E, VLS-128)
- Livox 3D LiDAR(Avia, Horizon, Mid40, Mid70, Tele, HAP, Mid360)
- RGB Camera
- RGBD Camera
- Panoramic Camera
- Fisheye Camera (Equidistant and [EUCM][external-EUCM-link] models with adjustable parameters)
- IMU
- GNSS
- (GroundTruth)
- (TF)

Both the `Panoramic Camera` and `Fisheye Camera` are based on cubemap projection. 
To avoid seams between cubemap faces, you may need to disable some post-processing effects and use fixed exposure.

**2. UnitySensorROS**

This package is responsible to make the link between sensor and ROS by serializing sensor raw data and sending to them to ROS using [ROS-TCP-Connector][external-RosTCPConnector-link] package.
To receive the data in ROS take a look at [ROS-TCP-Endpoint][external-RosTCPEndpoint-link].

## üöÄ Quick start

### Inside Unity3D

> \[!NOTE]
>
> UnitySensors is made for Unity 2022.3 or later
>
> If you are using Unity 2022.3 with the Built-in Render Pipeline, you need to change the materials of the Depth Camera, RGBD Camera, and Depth Buffer Lidar to ones with the "Legacy" suffix.

1. Open the Package Manager from `Window` -> `Package Manager`.
2. In the Package Manager window, find and click the + button in the upper lefthand corner of the window. Select `Add package from git URL....`

3. Enter the git URL for the desired package.
    1. For the UnitySensors, enter `https://github.com/Field-Robotics-Japan/UnitySensors.git?path=/Packages/UnitySensors#3.0.0`.
    2. For the UnitySensorsROS, enter `https://github.com/Field-Robotics-Japan/UnitySensors.git?path=/Packages/UnitySensorsROS#3.0.0`.
    __Note: UnitySensorsROS does not contain UnitySensors.__
4. Click `Add`.
5. Import sample assets of UnitySensors and UnitySensorsROS from `Window` -> `Package Manager` -> `UnitySensors` or `UnitySensorsROS` -> `Import Sample`.

### Inside ROS workspace

1. Download lastest release of [ROS-TCP-Endpoint][external-RosTCPEndpoint-release-link].
2. Build your workspace.
3. Launch ROS endpoint node.

### Migrating to URP/HDRP

Please refer to [Migrating to URP/HDRP](MigrateToURP&HDRP.md).
